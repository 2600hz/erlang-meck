- Allow wildcards in history functions
  (Might break backwards compatibility in rare cases where code relies on 
   the '_' atom as a normal atom, it is now the wildcard pattern)
- Add caller Pid to history
  *CAUTION* This will break backwards compatibility for functions that rely
  on the return value of history/1!
